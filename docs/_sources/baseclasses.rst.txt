Base Classes
============

Base classes are Objects that are used to provide a common set of elements to other objects by inheritance. Base classes should not be referenced directly in instance documents.

Current base classes include:

* Entity - elements that describe various organizations or individuals.
* Product - elements that describe a produce (e.g., module or inverter).
