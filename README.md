# Versioning

The Orange Button Solar Taxonomy uses calendar versioning, following the pattern YYMM.mm.pp, where YY is a two-digit year, MM is a zero-padded month, mm is a minor release integer, and pp is a patch integer. New major versions are anticipated to be released at 6 month intervals.

Major releases are not intended to be backward compatible, where minor releases are backward compatible. Patches are intended to replace their parent major/minor release.

Changes to the taxonomy are organized according to table below.
